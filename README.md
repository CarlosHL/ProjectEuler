# ProjectEuler
Respostery for exercises of https://projecteuler.net/

Solutions are provided in java and python by now. 

Posting the solutions of the problems, or looking for them, is against the nature of the project. However, I am using this as a challenge to improve my logical thinking, learn java and python, and as a project for a class at CU Boulder. Only solutions of the easy ones will be posted here.
If you came here for the current solution, you will be able to find better ones somewhere else. If you came to see a different solution or explanation of a concrete problem that you have already complete, be more than welcome to have a look.
